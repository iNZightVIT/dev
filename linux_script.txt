### INSTALL iNZightVIT on Linux ---------------------------------------- ###
# (development build. Will contain bugs --- if you find any, please
#  report to <tell029@aucklanduni.ac.nz>!

# NB: these instructions haven't been vigorously tested, and there may
#     be some version-specific dependencies missing. If this is the case,
#     simply install (apt-get if it's a linux one, of install.packages()
#     if it's for R). If you could email me any additional steps you needed,
#     it would be appreciated.

### -------------------------------------------------------------------- ###

# In the Terminal:
# Set up R
sudo apt-get install r-base
sudo apt-get install r-cran-rgtk2 r-cran-rgl r-cran-rodbc r-cran-cairodevice

# Move to R
R
install.packages("devtools")
update.packages()  # apt-get may have installed older versions, so you
# need to update you need to type 'y' and press enter for all of the
# packages that are out of date this may take a while... so you may
# want to get a cup of coffee or something.

# We need some packages for the GUI
install.packages(c("gdata", "gpairs", "objectProperties", "cairoDevice",
                   "MASS", "effects", "boot", "car", "s20x",
                   "fields", "lattice"))
library(devtools)
install_github("gWidgets2", "jverzani")  # we are using a development version
install_github("gWidgets2RGtk2", "jverzani")

# Now you're hopefully ready to install the iNZight packages
install_github(c("iNZightTS", "iNZightRegression", "iNZightMR",
                 "iNZightModules", "iNZightPlots", "iNZight"), "iNZightVIT")

# Make sure iNZight loads:
library(iNZight)
iNZight()

# If so, try for VIT
install.packages(c("car", "gWidgets", "gWidgetsRGtk2", "plyr"))
q("no")

# Back in terminal, install these (for better graphics)
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev-lts-  # press tab twice and select the correct version
sudo apt-get install libglu-dev libxt-dev libfreetype6-dev fontconfig

# And install in R
R
install.packages("Acinonyx", repos = "http://rforge.net/")
library(devtools)
install_github("VIT", "iNZightVIT")

# If all went well ...
library(vit)
iNZightVIT()

# ... you have iNZightVIT on Linux. Enjoy.
