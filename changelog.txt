  of new version of grob default fill is write. It will cover all the thing you execute 
  rectangle object before.

iNZightPlots v1.0.1
- [new] add ability to specify type of plot using `largesample = {TRUE,FALSE,NULL}`
  where `TRUE` uses grid plot, `FALSE` uses scatter plot, and `NULL` decides

  This allows locator functionality, as well as custom additions to the plot.
