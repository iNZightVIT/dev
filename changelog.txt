NEXT RELEASE:

iNZight v2.0.3
- [new] can now cycle through all two-variable plots for a selected Variable 1
- [fix] identify functionality works for subsets (except when multi plots at once)
- [change] can now specify to identify min/max points in a dot plot

iNZightPlots v1.0.3
- [bugfix] specifying `g2.level` with numbers wasn't working, has been fixed for plots,
  summary and inference information.

iNZightModules v1.0.3
- [new] the pairs plot, or scatter plot matrix, now takes a grouping variable.
- [change] the pairs/scatter plot matrix draws a jittered dotplot rather than a 
  barcode plot.
- [new] 2-variable explore plots in the Quick Explore menu

UPDATE RELEASE: 04/04/2014

iNZightPlots v1.0.2
- [bugfix] print the correct x-variable name when showing summary information
  for a quadratic trend.

iNZightRegression v1.1.2
- [change] implemented partial residual plots to use iNZightPlots
  graphics when they are available.

iNZightModules v1.0.2
- [change] lots of changes to the Time Series module, allowing multiplicative
  trends to fit, as well as y-axis labels specification.

iNZightTS v1.1.2
- [bugfix] slight changes, and add ylab to all plots.

RELEASE VERSION 2.0.1: 28/03/2014

iNZight v2.0.1
+ [new] add ability to specify type of plot; (default, dotplot, histogram) and
  (default, scatterplot, grid-density)
+ [new] add ability to convert missing observations to categorical levels
+ [new] add vertical sliders to the "Rename variables" and "Rename factor levels" windows
+ [new] identify feature added to "Add to plot", which enables users to interactively 
  label points by id, or any other selected variable.
+ [bugfix] reorder levels and sort them by frequency now works correctly
+ [bugfix] iNZight now correctly doesn't close if confirmation is denied

iNZightTS v1.1.1
+ [bugfix] change the gpar of fill to NA of every rectangle object due to the reason 
  of new version of grob default fill is write. It will cover all the thing you execute 
  rectangle object before.
+ [new] add comparisonplot and get.x2 right now. get.x2 is a tools like get.x but return the
  proportion value between (0,1] and it is calculating by using order to control the xaxis.
+ [bugfix] quick-fix for an issue with loading the grid package
  

iNZightPlots v1.0.1
+ [new] add ability to specify type of plot using `largesample = {TRUE,FALSE,NULL}`
  where `TRUE` uses grid plot, `FALSE` uses scatter plot, and `NULL` decides
  based on the sample size (default)
+ [change] the final viewport is the main data window, rather than the plot labels. 
  This allows locator functionality, as well as custom additions to the plot.
+ [change] display which variables cannot be plot due to too many levels, as well as the
  number of levels. Also increased max levels to 101.
+ [new] add trend line and smoothers to legend.
+ [bugfix] fix a bug where grid-density plot wasn't scaling properly with the axes.
+ [change] instead of using the absolute counts to decide what shade to use for 
  grid-density plot, now uses quantiles, as when there are a few large numbers this was
  resulting in a monotone of grey with a single black square in the middle.


iNZightRegression v1.1.1
+ [change] add maximum sample size (4000) for drawing bootstraps, as over this computation
  time becomes too much and not much is gained from the bootstraps.
+ [new] all plots implemented using the iNZightPlots functions, which builds on the
  grid package. This provides speedier graphics, and simpler investigation with large
  sample sizes.
+ [change] smoothers on residual plots now use 50% quantile smoothers, rather than 
  loess smoothers (on the `grid` based version only), which greatly increases efficiency.
+ [change] p-values for normality (shapiro-wilk test) show P < 0.001 when it rounds down 
  to 0.
+ [bugfix] fixed issue with shapiro wilk test when sample size > 5000
