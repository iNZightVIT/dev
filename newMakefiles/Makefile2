# Build iNZight from scratch

# Create an iNZight (or whatever) directory somewhere, and tell us what it's called:
DIR = ~/iNZight

# Inside that, you need to clone this repository: git clone git@github.com:iNZightVIT/dev.git

# These are the iNZight packages we need to use/create:
inz_packages = iNZightTS iNZightRegression iNZightMR iNZightTools iNZightModules iNZightPlots iNZight vit
# And the couple of gWidgets packages we use for their updated-ness:
g_packages = gWidgets2 gWidgets2RGtk2
# And everything together:
all_packages = $(g_packages) $(inz_packages)


# STEP 1: BUILD the development environment
build:
	@for pkg in $(inz_packages) iNZightVIT-WIN ; do \
		cd $(DIR); git clone git@github.com:iNZightVIT/$$pkg ; \
	done
	@for pkg in $(g_packages) ; do \
		cd $(DIR); git clone git@github.com:jverzani/$$pkg ; \
	done

# STEP 2: INSTALL the iNZight software on your local machine (this assumes you have R v 3.1.z and
# the necessary GTK and blah set up - basically, install iNZight following website details for
# linux)
install:
	@cd $(DIR); R CMD INSTALL $(all_packages); echo '\n\nSuccessfully installed all iNZight packages from github.\n\n'

# For compatibility and all that, you will also need to install R versions 2.15(.3) and 3.0(.2) on
# your machine - then tell me what they're called:
R2 = ~/R-2.15.3/bin/R
R3 = ~/R-3.0.2/bin/R

oldRinstall:
	@cd $(DIR); R2 CMD INSTALL $(all_packages); R3 CMD INSTALL $(all_packages); '\n\nSuccessfully installed all iNZight packages from github for old version of R.\n\n'


# STEP 3: GET the Windows and Mac versions of iNZightVIT from github:
getWin:
	cd $(DIR); git clone git@github.com:iNZightVIT/iNZightVIT-WIN.git
